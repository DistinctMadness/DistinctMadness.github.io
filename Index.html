        <h1>Rules</h1>
        <p>The rules for the SpeedRunners Pro League Season #1 follow a similar guideline as to the ESL Go4SpeedRunners rules, however there are a few exceptions. These exceptions include having to play all 5 games, regardless of mid-result. The rules are a guideline and the decisions by admins may differ depending on the circumstances. We make every effort to ensure the rules are complete and up to date but this may not always be the case. All players must follow all the rules listed on this page and should regularly check for updates. If you have any questions about the rules, please contact KernelPad.</p>
        <h3>1. Cup Rules</h3>
        <p><b>1.1. No-show</b>
            <br /> The general idea is that the players amongst themselves figure out a suitable timing for each other, this even includes having to sacrifice your own time. If a contestant is not ready to play or unavailable during the whole week, the period may be extended. Matches with your opponent should not take any longer than a whole week because it is one opponent per week. If a contestant chooses to forfeit a match, they will recieve a match result of 0-5. If they forfeit during the Playoffs, they will forfeit any prizes and if possible will be replaced by their opponent in the previous round.</p>
        <p><b>1.1.1. Results, Scheduling & Protests</b>
            <br/> You must post your match results AND any protests you may have with the Pro League on the official steam thread. When reporting score, simply state who won and what the result was. If you wish to view who you're playing against, view the spreadsheet and click on the 'SCHEDULE' sheet. Simply contact your opponent and arrange the match for the corresponding week.</p>
        <h3>2. Map Selection & Format</h3>
        <p><b>2.1. Illegal Maps</b>
            <br /> Workshop Custom Maps (choosing a specific workshop map from the 'Workshop Levels' column) is strictly forbidden, under no circumstances shall a player vote for a workshop map unless it is picked randomly through the 'Random Workshop' selection. In other words, if a player wishes to play a workshop level map, they must select the 'Random Workshop' option on the map selection screen.</p>
        <p><b>2.2.1. League Match Format</b>
            <br /> A match consists of 5 games, you MUST play all 5 games regardless of result. This is not a Best of 5.
            <br />For example, if the result is currently 3-0, you will play the next two games where the result may be 4-1, 3-2 or 5-0. This is ONLY for the League matches, not Playoffs.</p>
        <p><b>2.2.2. Playoffs Match Format</b>
            <br /> At the end of the seven weeks, the top four players in each division will have qualified for the playoffs. The playoffs is a standard single elimination tournament that will decide the ultimate champion. The bracket starts with 'Round of 8' which consists of 8 players and 4 matches. The match format at this stage is Best of 9. Proceeding to the next stage, 'Round of 4', also known as the Semi-finals is played using the Best of 11 format. The Finals is played using the Best of 15 format.</p>
        <p><b>2.2.3. Map Choice</b>
            <br /> The player with the higher seed (higher position on the table or tournament) picks the first map. The player with the higher seed (higher position on the table or tournament) picks the first map. Players must take turns in picking maps until the last round. The last map MUST be RANDOM OFFICIAL! For example, Player 1 picks, Player 2 picks, Player 1 picks, Player 2 picks then both pick Random Official.</p>
        <h3>3. Match Rules</h3>
        <p><b>3.1. Player drops</b>
            <br /> If a player drops in the first 2 minutes of a match, and there has been no contact between opponents, the game may be re-hosted. In general, a game is always re-hosted unless the remaining player had a significant advantage (very likely victory). Make sure you take a screenshot of the current standings and restart the game to play the leftover rounds. The waiting time for a dropped player is 20 minutes, afterwards the match may be considered abandnoned by the opponent. Read section 3.1.3.</p>
        <p><b>3.1.1. Re-host</b>
            <br /> In a re-hosted game, each player has to choose the same map as they picked at the start of the the original game. Bugs and crashes are warrant for a match re-host if both competitors agree.</p>
        <p><b>3.1.2. Pausing a Game</b>
            <br /> A player can only pause the match at the lobby screen, they must also state the reason for the interruption and how long it will approximately take. The game can only be resumed by the player that paused the game after they ask their opponent if they are ready. Violation of this rule are handled as unsportsmanlike behaviour and can lead to a re-match.</p>
        <p><b>3.1.3. Abandonment of a Match</b>
            <br /> If your opponent should deliberately leave during a match, you must make take a video/screenshot and talk to KernelPad. Should the game have advanced to a point at which an evaluation of the result is possible, a win may be granted to the remaining player. The decision whether a match can be evaluated or not is in each case decided by the responsible admin.</p>
        <p><b>3.1.4. Illegal Actions</b>
            <br /> All forms of cheating in Pro League matches are forbidden and will be penalized by tinyBuild. This includes but not limited to a player using an alternate account, a substitute or a SpeedRunners related utility/application that can result in an unfair advantage.</p>
        <p><b>3.1.5. Game Settings</b>
            <br /> A custom lobby with the following preset options: Tournament Settings: â˜‘</p>
        <h3>4. MatchMedia</h3>
        <p><b>4.1. Screenshots/Replays</b>
            <br /> All match media (screenshots, demos, etc) must be kept for at least 14 days. Faking or manipulating match media is of-course forbidden and will result in severe penalties. Match media should be named clearly based on what it is.</p>
        <h3>5. Casting</h3>
        <p><b>5.1. Personal Streaming</b>
            <br /> Personal Streaming is always allowed if tinyBuild is not casting a match. </p>
